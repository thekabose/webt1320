            <h3>The Honored One</h3>
            <p>Gojo Satoru is the gassest character from hit series Sorcery Fight.
                He is also the strongest character due to his many gas techniques.
                Gojo Satoru is the only surviving member of the Gojo clan.
                The clan is very powerful for their limitless technique and six eyes.
                He is a very popular character in media getting recognition from Usher!
                He is often compared to Buddha, due to his journey as a character and this quote from this panel below.

            <p>Nah, he'd win. This is my favorite picture of Gojo.
                It was his famous words before he went into battle against the strongest 
                curse in the series, Sukuna. The battle was gas.
